HLDB (**h**yper**l**ocal **d**ata**b**ase) is a database protocol which provides peer-to-peer collaboration without consensus. The protocol is based on these two papers:

1. [Merkle-CRDTs: Merkle-DAGs meet CRDTs](https://research.protocol.ai/publications/merkle-crdts-merkle-dags-meet-crdts/)
2. [Byzantine Eventual Consistency and the Fundamental Limits of Peer-to-Peer Databases](https://github.com/ept/byzantine-eventual)
